: 2013-11-14 Release 0.3.2:
  - Project is resurrected and rewritten in Pascal. Yet still only runs a
    script with the same name as the executable.
  - Lua library is dynamically loaded runtime, either version 5.1 or 5.2
    but which one is hard coded at compile time (it's a pre-support for future
    version).

: 2010-07-27 Release 0.3.1:
  - New project host: SourceForge.net


== Introduction ==

=== What is it? ===

Lua Built-In program (L-Bia) is a self-running Lua interpreter. It turns
your Lua program with all required modules (either Lua or C libraries)
and an interpreter into a single stand-alone executable program.

**WARNING:** This version doesn't do that, it only run a lua script with
the same name as the executable. I'm rewriting it due to many bugs in previous
versions.

=== Why should I use it? ===

L-Bia makes the things simpler, because:

- You don't need to distribute many files
- You don't need to install or have any prior software indalled
- Runs in any computer from any media (floppies, CD-ROMs, USB sticks or other)
- Multi-platform, simple and easy to use


Please note that L-Bia turns your program into an executable program. And an
executable program for Windows doesn't run on Linux or other. You need to
create an executable for each platform.

So if your users are likely to always have the normal Lua interpreter installed,
forget about L-Bia. But if your users are likely to not even heard about Lua,
L-Bia is perfect for you.

=== Do I have to pay for it? ===

**Absolutely NO!** L-Bia is freely available under the terms of GNU General
Public License. Contrary to popular belief, it can be used in comercial
software! See #LICENSE for details. The latest version of L-Bia can be
downloaded from its [SourceForge http://sourceforge.net/projects/l-bia/files/]
page.

=== Supported features ===

- Run a lua script with the same name as the executable.


== OK, I want it. Now what? ==

=== Download ===

The latest version of L-Bia can be downloaded from its
[SourceForge http://sourceforge.net/projects/l-bia/files/] page.

=== Build and Run ===

You need the Free Pascal compiler. Just type ``fpc l-bia`` and you're done.
But you need the appropriate Lua dynamic library.

Now ``l-bia`` run ``l-bia.lua``, if you want to run ``hello.lua`` rename the
executable to ``hello``. They must be in same directory and also any other
files needed.

== Thanks ==

- **Waldemar Celes** and **Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo**, the autors
  of Lua, for portions of code I used in L-Bia.
- **Markus Franz Xaver Johannes Oberhumer** for miniLZO - mini subset of the
  LZO real-time data compression library.
- **Aurelio Marinho Jargas** for his ``txt2tags`` text formatting and
  conversion tool used in these docs and things I plagiarized him
  (plagiarism is my favorite buzzword :)
- Many tanks also to **all those who sent me //feedback//**, I realy
  appreciate it.
